# TicTacToe
This is a tictactoe game meants to practice objects, factory functions, IIFE's and JS specific OOP like prototyping. 
Secondary goal is to encapsulate as much code as possible using Closure and the module pattern.

I learned:
- Semicoloning appropriately at the end of statements
- IIFE's
- Factory Functions to return objects without the new keyword
- Closure and encapsulating private variables/helper functions
- The Module code design pattern

The game will feature:
- 2 player mode
- 1v1 Human and Human vs. AI
- The AI will have 2 modes, random selection, and minmax'd perfect AI.
- Players take turns to place either X or O. When there is either 3 in a row for either player or a tie, the game is over.
- Click anywhere to start a new game.
